<div><img src="/img/nick.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Nick Taylor profile photo" class="profile-photo" /> I am a Senior Software Developer at Autodesk working on the <a href="https://www.shotgunsoftware.com" title="Shotgun">Shotgun</a> product. I am a big fan of TypeScript, JavaScript, React and Node. Once upon a time, I was into C#/ASP.NET. Aside from programming, I enjoy hitting the gym, snowboarding in the winter and a long long time ago, rugby. I am also not a big fan of spiders. <img src="/img/nick-rugby.jpg" alt="Nick playing rugby" width="150" height="150" class="sports-photo" /></div>

I enjoy contributing to open source. Here are some highlights of my most recent open source work.

- I enabled automatic dependency updates for this site using Netlify, Dependabot and Cypress. You can read about it in my post, [Update Dependencies with Dependabot, Cypress and Netlify](https://www.iamdeveloper.com/blog/2019-08-15-update-dependencies-with-dependabot-cypress-and-netlify/).

- [dev.to repository](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/commits?author=nickytonline). I gained early access to the repository while it was still private and was the first developer to contribute to the repository outside of the core team. Since then I have contributed quite a bit to the codebase, mainly in the frontend. I also cross-post my blog posts to [dev.to](https://dev.to/nickytonline).

- [coryhouse/react-slingshot · GitHub](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot/commits?author=nickytonline). I contributed quite a bit to this repository when I started to learn React/Redux and then I was asked and accepted to become a maintainer of the repository.

- [Converting tota11y to a browser extension](https://github.com/Khan/tota11y/pull/131). This is not merged but you can use this PR as an unpacked browser extension. For more information, see my post, [An a11y extension coming to a browser near you](https://www.iamdeveloper.com/blog/2019-03-31-an-a11y-extension-coming-to-a-browser-near-you/).
