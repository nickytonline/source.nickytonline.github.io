<img src="/img/nick.jpg" alt="Nick Taylor profile photo" class="profile-photo" /> I am a Senior Software Developer at Autodesk working on the [Shotgun](https://www.shotgunsoftware.com) product. I am a big fan of TypeScript, JavaScript, React and Node. Once upon a time, I was into C#/ASP.NET. I am also not a big fan of spiders.

I love contributing to open source. Here are some highlights of my most recent open source work.

-   I enabled automatic dependency updates for this site using Netlify, Dependabot and Cypress. You can read about it in my post, [Update Dependencies with Dependabot, Cypress and Netlify](https://www.iamdeveloper.com/blog/2019-08-15-update-dependencies-with-dependabot-cypress-and-netlify/).

-   [https://dev.to repository](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/commits?author=nickytonline). I gained early access to the repository while it was still private and was the first developer to contribute to the repository outside of the core team. Since then I have contributed quite a bit to the codebase, mainly in the frontend. I also cross-post my blog posts to [dev.to](https://dev.to/nickytonline).
-   [coryhouse/react-slingshot Â· GitHub](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot/commits?author=nickytonline). I contributed quite a bit to this repository when I started to learn React/Redux and then I was asked and accepted to become a maintainer of the repository.

-   [Converting tota11y to a browser extension](https://github.com/Khan/tota11y/pull/131). This is not merged but you can use this PR as an unpacked browser extension. For more information, see my post, [An a11y extension coming to a browser near you](https://www.iamdeveloper.com/blog/2019-03-31-an-a11y-extension-coming-to-a-browser-near-you/).
