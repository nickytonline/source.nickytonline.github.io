Alright, so Phil Nash [roped me into this one](https://dev.to/philnash/comment/518o). This keeps in line with my other posts that are ‚ÄúNot just a Gist‚Äù. If you want to read about those posts, check out [mac.iamdeveloper.com](https://mac.iamdeveloper.com) and [vscode.iamdeveloper.com](https://vscode.iamdeveloper.com). This post's birth comes from [gitaliases.iamdeveloper.com](https://gitaliases.iamdeveloper.com) which is essentially a copy paste of my git aliases.

I'm going to provide my list of git aliases and explain what each alias does, plain and simple. Let's get started! üèÅ For those new to git aliases, please see the [defacto docs on aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases).

Before we get started, why git aliases? Well for one thing, I don't know about you, but some git commands are hard to remember and also, we're programmers, which means we're lazy by default to be efficient. üê¢ --> üêá

1. `alias.a add .` -
   Running `git add` will add all files that have changed as staged.

1. `alias.aliases config --get-regexp alias` -
   Running `git aliases` will show all the aliases you have configured globally in git.

1. `alias.bi bisect` -
   Running `git bi` will run git's [bisect](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) to help you figure out which commit has a bug.

1. `alias.ci commit -m` -
   This will commit a file with the message you specify, e.g. `git ci "awesome commit!"`.

1. `alias.co checkout` -
   This will checkout the branch you specify, e.g. `git co my-awesome-branch`

1. `alias.colast checkout -` -
   Running `git colast` will checkout the previous branch you were working in.

1. `alias.db branch -D` -
   This will delete the branch you specify, e.g. `git db my-not-so-awesome-branch`. Note that this will only work if the branch you're deleting is not the one you're currently working in.

1. `alias.laf fsck --lost-found` -
   Running `git laf` will bring you to [git's lost and found](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-lost-found). I'll admit that I rarely use this, so perhaps it doesn't warrant an alias and just some professional Googling.

1. `alias.last log -1 HEAD` -
   Running `git last` will show you what your last commit was.

1. `alias.nb checkout -b` -
   This will create a new branch, e.g. `git nb my-awesome-branch`.

1. `alias.pror remote prune origin` -
   Running `git pror` will do some cleanup on the `origin` remote via [pruning](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-prune).

1. `alias.pr pull --rebase` -
   This will rebase your current branch with the branch specified, e.g. `git pr develop`.

1. `alias.ra rebase --abort` -
   Running `git ra` will abort a [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase). Run this when you're like, my rebase is currently messed up. Get me outta here!

1. `alias.rc rebase --continue` -
   Running `git rc` will continue a [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase). You typically run this when you've handled any conflicts in a rebase.

1. `alias.pf push --force-with-lease` -
   Running `git pf` forces a push, but it is a little less destructive than forcing a push. See here for more info on [--force-with-lease vs. --force](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/04/force-with-lease).

1. `alias.psu push --set-upstream` -
   Run this when you want to push a branch for the first time to the remote (typically `origin`), e.g. `git psu origin my-awesome-branch`.

1. `alias.remotes remote -v` -
   Running `git remotes` shows all the remotes currently configured for a repository.

1. `alias.renb branch -m` -
   When you want to rename a branch, run e.g. `git renb my-awesom-branch my-awesome-branch`.

1. `alias.rhh reset --hard HEAD` -
   The nuclear option. Run `git rhh` to wipe out all you changes and start from the `HEAD`.

1. `alias.rh reset --hard` -
   When you specify what to reset to, a hard reset is performed, e.g. `git rh HEAD~2`.

1. `alias.s status -s` -
   Running `git s` will give you a more terse [status](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status). Instead of this

   ```bash
   On branch post/my-git-aliases
   Your branch is up to date with 'origin/post/my-git-aliases'.

   Changes not staged for commit:
     (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
     (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

           modified:   src/pages/articles/2018-08-24-my-git-aliases/index.md

   no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
   ```

   You get this

   ```bash
   M src/pages/articles/2018-08-24-my-git-aliases/index.md
   ```

1. `alias.stashes stash list` -
   Running `git stashes` shows you all the stashes you have from [stashing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing). e.g.

   ```bash
   stash@{0}: WIP on upgrade: bff6257 Destructuring OCD...
   stash@{1}: WIP on upgrade: 3d73199 Fixed LiceCap link.
   stash@{2}: WIP on upgrade: c2f78g6 Update default title.
   ```

1. `alias.unstash stash pop` -
   Running `git unstash` pops a stash off the list of saved stashes.

1. `alias.vc clean -dfx` -
   Running `git vc` cleans your git repository, so anything not in git is wiped, e.g. `node_modules`, settings files which aren't supposed to be in a repo etc. So BEWARE before you run this.

1. `alias.refactor commit -m üë∑Refactor` -
   When running `git refactor`, a generic refactor message is used for committing any staged files, i.e. `üë∑Refactor`. I'll probably improve on this to just allow a user to concatenate a custom message to it. But that's for another day.

1. `alias.formatting commit -m üíÖFormatting` -
   When running `git formatting`, a generic formatting message is used for committing any staged files, i.e. `üíÖFormatting`. I'll probably improve on this to just allow a user to concatenate a custom message to it. But that's for another day.

1. `alias.comments commit -m üìíComments` -
   When running `git comments`, a generic comments message is used for committing any staged files, i.e. `üìíComments`. I'll probably improve on this to just allow a user to concatenate a custom message to it. But that's for another day.

1. `alias.tests commit -m ‚úÖTests` -
   When running `git tests`, a generic tests message is used for committing any staged files, i.e. `‚úÖTests`. I'll probably improve on this to just allow a user to concatenate a custom message to it. But that's for another day.

1. `alias.prum pull --rebase upstream master` -
   Running `git prum` rebases your current branch off your upstream remote.
