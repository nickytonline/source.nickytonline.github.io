Like many developers, I decided to make a **uses** page as well. If you decide to make your own, consider adding it to [uses.tech](https://uses.tech]) that was created by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos).

I use a Mac so most tools are OS agnostic, but there are definitely some Mac only ones, e.g. xScope.
