Like many of you, I am participating in Hacktoberfest as well. Most of the contributions I have made in October have been for DEV. Here are the current PRs that have been merged so far:

* [Mini refactor to make variable names clearer in the Categories component](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/pull/4257)
* [Now eslint ignores the app/assets/javascripts/lib folder](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/pull/4323)
* [VS Code Settings Update / Frontend Debug Documentation](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/pull/4346)
* [Fixed a typo](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/pull/4374)


The other PR that is still under review is for the [learnstorybook.com](https://learnstorybook.com) website (repository https://github.com/chromaui/learnstorybook.com)

The PR adds a precommit hook to format markdown files via prettier and as well, I ran prettier on all the markdown files as a lot of files had not run through prettier previously. Here is the link to the PR, [All markdown files are properly formatted now](https://github.com/chromaui/learnstorybook.com/pull/181)

Although this is not from Hacktoberfest, the beauty of open source is that anyone can checkout what you are up to. I was super surprised and felt pretty good when Addy Osmani like one of my PRs for DEV.

I will probably contribute some more to the DEV codebase, but who knows, I may tackle an issue in another repository. YOLO.
