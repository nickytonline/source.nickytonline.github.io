So the other day, Egghead had one of their community live events, "LIVE! Build your own clone of React with Hooks from scratch w/ Shawn "swyx" Wang".

During the session, Shawn was to build a rudimentary implementation of React Hooks. I thought it would be fun to code along with him, but to write it in TypeScript.
