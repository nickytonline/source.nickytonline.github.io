So here’s my [2018 Resolutions - Just some dev](https://www.iamdeveloper.com/blog/2018-01-03-2018-resolutions/). Did I complete them all? No, but honestly it’s not a big deal.

- _Continue to contribute to open source._: Mission accomplished 🚀. I continued to be a collaborator on [react-slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) and contributed some work there this year, fielded some issues etc.
  <br /><br />
  My other focus was the [dev.to](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to) repository. I was accepted as an early contributor before the [project went open source](https://dev.to/ben/devto-is-now-open-source-5n1) and continued to contribute after it went public. It felt really good to be the [first contributor outside of the core team](https://dev.to/jess/dev-monthly-report--march-2018-579p) to have a PR merged.
  <br /><br />
  Although I didn’t contribute to TypeScript or VS Code, I’m still very happy with this year’s contributions.
- _Keep on blogging_: I continued to blog with a few blog posts and lots more short posts/comments on dev.to. People seemed to like “My Mac Setup” which was one of the most [popular posts for mid-January on dev.to](https://dev.to/thepracticaldev/the-7-most-popular-dev-posts-from-the-past-week-36c8). Work and life got busy so not as much blogging as I’d had hoped.
- _Start making stuff on [codepen.io](https://codepen.io)_: Prior to 2018, I had never made any. I made a few to have a bit of fun, but I didn’t maintain this.
  <br />
- _Read everything in my Pocket_: This just didn’t happen. In fact shortly after writing my 2018 resolutions, I stopped reading Pocket completely. It had nothing to do with the product, just got busy and when you add to Pocket, it’s like it’s just sent up in the ether. Having said that, I highly recommend this tool for offline reading. I’m gonna try and catch up on some reading while I head away to a chalet for a few days.
- _Read [Functional-Light JavaScript](https://leanpub.com/fljs)_: I got through about a third of it, and well, no excuses 🙃. Will have to finish this this year I guess 😉

It’s fun making resolutions, but honestly, I did not lose any sleep over not completing some of these. Aside from resolutions, it was a busy year in work land and in the fall I decided to move on to an amazing role at Autodesk on the [Shotgun team](https://www.shotgunsoftware.com).

Prior to starting work, I attended a week long conference with the whole team. We’re distributed, so they try to have these team conferences once or every two years. As a brand new employee who hadn’t even started work yet, it was amazing to meet, wine/dine with my future co-workers and work on ways to improve the product. I’ve been loving it since day 1. Great work/life balance and all the good things you look for in a job. 💯

Aside from the new gig, I'm about to pass 12000 followers on [dev.to](https://dev.to/nickytonline)! 🔥

So as we close off 2018, I just want to say thanks to the dev.to core team and the community. You're all great.
