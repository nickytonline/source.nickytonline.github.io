Before the [dev.to](https://dev.to) codebase was opensourced, I was working on it in the private repository and [created an issue](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/issues/383#issue-351630725) in there that has since been copied to the public repository (thanks [@maestromac](https://dev.to/maestromac)!).

Is this something that would interest people in the dev.to community who are contributing to the frontend codebase?

For those new to types, here's a post from Preethi Kasireddy about types, [Why use static types in JavaScript? (Part 1)](https://dev.to/iampeekay/why-use-static-types-in-javascript-part-1)

## TypeScript

I'm partial to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) myself. I've [written about it](https://www.iamdeveloper.com/blog/2017-10-07-consider-using-typescript/) here before.

There appears to be a shift towards TypeScript for those that are interested in types. I wrote about it earlier this year, [Is 2019 the year of TypeScript?](https://www.iamdeveloper.com/blog/2019-01-19-is-2019-the-year-of-typescript/)

There is also a great episode on the React Podcast that talks about TypeScript with Jared Palmer.

Also check out the [TypeScript tag](https://dev.to/t/typescript) on dev.to

## Flow

[Flow](https://flow.org/) is another main option in the frontend in regards to types. I've never used it myself, but it's also in use in some large codebases.

Here are some links if you want to read up on Flow.

* [An Introduction to Flow](https://pusher.com/sessions/meetup/js-monthly-london/flow)
* [Flow: A Static Type Checker for JavaScript](https://dzone.com/articles/flow-a-static-type-checker-for-javascript)
* I honestly did not really find many posts on dev.to about Flow, but feel free to check out the [flow tag](https://dev.to/t/flow).

I'd like to start the discussion here, but feel free to jump in on the issue in the repository to discuss there as well.

I've narrowed it down to those two as they are the most popular, but feel free to bring others to the table to discuss.

## Vanilla JSüç¶

If you really don't want to see the codebase converted to use types, that's OK too.
